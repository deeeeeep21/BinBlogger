## Setup Process

> ‚ùóMake sure You have python3 and pip installed on your machine.

### Step 1

1. Create a folder where you want to clone the project.
   - I am creating a folder named ‚Äòexample‚Äô in desktop

2. Now navigate to "example" via cmd or terminal

(Mac)

```bash
cd ~/desktop/example
```

(Windows)

 ```shell
cd C:\Users\YourDesktopName\Desktop\example
 ```

### Step 2

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è *Optional but better to use a virtual environment for every project.*

If don‚Äôt have any virtual environment manager installed in your machine then install one. (I will use pipenv)

For installing pipenv run

```bash
pip install pipenv
```

1. Now clone the project and navigate to BinBlogger-master

```bash
git clone git@github.com:m-nobinur/BinBlogger.git
cd BinBlogger-master
```

2. Install all the dependencies for the project.


```bash
pipenv install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Activate the virtual environment

```bash
pipenv shell
```

### Step 3

1. Create a .env file in the project directory, open it with your favorite text editor and paste the bellow lines

```.file
SECRET_KEY=[YOUR SECRET_KEY]
DEBUG=True
MAILCHIMP_API_KEY=[YOUR MAILCHIMP_API_KEY]
MAILCHIMP_DATA_CENTER=[YOUR MAILCHIMP_DATA_CENTER]
MAILCHIMP_EMAIL_LIST_ID=[YOUR MAILCHIMP_DATA_CENTER]
```

2. Now generate a secret key for your project.

run python on your shell

```bash
python
```

``` python
>>>from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key
>>>get_random_secret_key()
>>>[ YOUR SECRET KEY ]
```

3. Copy the secret key, open .env file again and assign the secret key. If you don't have mailchimp credentials then make sure your file look like this

```.file
SECRET_KEY=YOUR_SECRET_KEY
DEBUG=True
MAILCHIMP_API_KEY=''
MAILCHIMP_DATA_CENTER=''
MAILCHIMP_EMAIL_LIST_ID=''
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è make sure not to use any space between the equal(=) sign or any quotations(‚Äú) for the secret key

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è
> If you want to setup Mailchimp now then go to this [section](mailchimp_setup.md)

4. You are all setup, let‚Äôs migrate now.

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

5. Create a superuser to rule the site üòé

```bash
python manage.py create superuser

```

> *follow the instructions*

6. Hahh! Long wait. Let‚Äôs visit the site now

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
